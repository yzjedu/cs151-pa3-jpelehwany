I really enjoyed this assignment. It felt like a very nice chnage of pace when it came to working with
ASCII art. The issues that caused me the most trouble were the error checkings of the inputs, and sometimes the
ASCII arts I was using used two apostrophe marks, which would mess up the print statement. I had to settle with opening
and closing each print statement with ("""three quotation marks""") to not only indent the art down one line but to also
prevent it from causing errors. Some messages appear about *warnings*, not errors, about the possibility of "invalid escape sequences".
This is not an issue to the code itself though.

Overall, this lab was a very good and thought-provoking exercise in Python.
